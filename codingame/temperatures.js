/*
The Goal
In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

	
Sample temperatures
Here, -1 is the closest to 0.

Rules
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 	Game Input
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.
Input
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
Example
Input
5
1 -2 -8 4 5
Output

1
